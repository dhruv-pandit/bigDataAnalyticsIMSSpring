    "### Understanding Iterables, Iteration, and List Comprehensions  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into code, let’s first understand the fundamental concepts of iterables, iteration, and list comprehensions—key building blocks for working with data efficiently in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is an Iterable?  \n",
    "An iterable is any Python object that can return its elements one at a time. Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and even strings are iterables because they contain multiple elements that can be accessed sequentially. Think of an iterable like a script of a Friends episode—each line is stored in order, and you can go through it one by one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Iteration?  \n",
    "Iteration is the process of going through an iterable, accessing each element in turn. This is done using loops or special functions that retrieve elements automatically. For example, when we loop through a list of Friends characters and print each name, we are iterating over that list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration is crucial in programming because it allows us to process data dynamically—whether that means counting the number of lines Joey has in Season 2, finding the most common words in dialogues, or filtering episodes with high IMDb ratings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is an Iterator?  \n",
    "An iterator is a special type of iterable that remembers its position while iterating. It follows the iterator protocol, meaning it implements two methods:  \n",
    "- `__iter__()` → Returns the iterator itself.  \n",
    "- `__next__()` → Returns the next item in the sequence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike regular iterables, iterators don’t restart when exhausted—they must be recreated. You can think of this like watching an episode of Friends: if you pause and resume later, you continue from where you left off.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a List Comprehension?  \n",
    "A list comprehension is a concise and readable way to create lists by applying an operation to each element in an iterable. Instead of writing a loop to filter or transform data, we can express it in a single line.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, instead of writing multiple lines to collect all dialogue lines spoken by Ross, we can use a list comprehension to do it in one compact expression. This makes code more readable, efficient, and Pythonic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use List Comprehensions?  \n",
    "List comprehensions have several advantages:  \n",
    "- Concise: Reduces the number of lines needed for simple operations.  \n",
    "- Efficient: Runs faster than using explicit loops in many cases.  \n",
    "- Readable: Expresses filtering and transformations in an intuitive way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we wanted to get all episodes with more than 10 million US viewers, a loop would take multiple lines, while a list comprehension could do it in just one.  \n",
    "\n"
