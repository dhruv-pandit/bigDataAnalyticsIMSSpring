# Big Data Analytics - Lab Class Repository

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **Big Data Analytics** lab sessions. This repository contains all the materials, code examples, datasets, and resources used throughout the semester.

## 🔍 Overview

This course introduces the foundations and tools for processing, analyzing, and drawing insights from big data. The labs complement the lectures by giving students hands-on experience with technologies such as:

- Apache Spark (DataFrames, SQL, Streaming, MLlib)
- Python for data manipulation and analysis
- Functional programming patterns (via `Fluent Python`)
- Distributed data processing principles

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To follow the labs on your own machine:
## 🛠️ Getting Started

All lab work will be conducted on [Databricks Community Edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/), a free cloud-based environment for running Apache Spark notebooks.

To get started:

1. Sign up or log in at [Databricks Community Edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/).
2. Create a new **Workspace** and **Cluster** (default settings are fine for the first few weeks -  later weeks might require specific ML Clusters).
3. Import the lab notebooks into your Workspace from this repository using:
   - URL import, or
   - Clone the repository, download the files, and upload them into your workspace.
4. Attach the notebook to your cluster and run the cells interactively.
